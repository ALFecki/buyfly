## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Kotlin] - cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference.
- [Micronaut] - modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications.
- [Jetpack Compose] - Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI.

There is an UML-class diagram of project, that shows exemplary project architecture:
